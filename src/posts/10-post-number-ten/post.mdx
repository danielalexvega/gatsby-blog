## my first mdx file

**The times we live in require us to think critically: to second-guess, to interrogate, to fact-check, and to doubt.** Anything less, and our entire worldview will be determined by whatever story is spun in our general direction. To be a sentient human in 2020 is to resist the mythology being written all around us and understand that most things are too complex to be the story of one Great Man changing the course of history. But how the hell, then, are we supposed to understand someone like LeBron James?

<div className="code">

```js
const firstName = 'john'
```

<div className="nice-text">

<h3>nice text </h3>
